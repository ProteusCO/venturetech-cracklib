====================

Cracklib with patches for venture tech software.

You can specify your own custom word list by setting the system property cracklib.package.override to the name of the package 
that contains files named words.pack.hwm, words.pack.pwd, and words.pack.pwi.

You must specify cracklib.package.override like this:  

```
-Dcracklib.package.override=/com/example/folder
```

The program 'cracklib-packer' which is part of Linux PAM can be used to create the custom wordlist files.  Also, the
utility cracklib-format can help create a file to run through cracklib-packer. 

For example:
```
cracklib-format ./words.in  | cracklib-packer ./words.pack
```

Warning for your sanity:  It seems like cracklib-packer may be skipping the first word in it's input file. 
So, if you were to try using the addition of the word aardvark as your testcase
you may find out that aardvark is still allowed since it is likely to appear
first in the alphabetized file generated by cracklib-format.  You may want to
include an extra word such as aaaaaaaa to avoid this issue if you're really passionate
about banning 100% of the words in your list.
